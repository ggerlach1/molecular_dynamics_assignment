# Molecular Dynamics Assignment for Graduate Structural Biology Class

This assignment was created for use in Introduction to Computational Structural Biology (MSCBIO 2030/CMPBIO 2030/COBB 2030.

Included are all necessary files to run a 50 ns AMBER simulation on cluster which uses SLURM queueing.The assignment introduces students to:
1. What is required for an MD assignment 
2. Using a cluster for work

The assignment that was given to the class is `assignment_instructions.tex`. Within `analysis` are basic instructions for doing the necessary analysis.

The students found the assignment easy to follow. Students which had previous experience using a cluster for work had minimal if any issues, and other students also found it to be an approachable assignment.
